            party.confetti(runButton, {
                    count: party.variation.range(80, 100)
                },
        );
    }

main aim of this site is that it reaches a particular friend at dead 12:00 a.m. and gives a certificate to that recepient. Also happy birthday to her or whatever. if it works well..... success.
